Why are we not setting up visual feedback when an interaction is graded?

I thought leaving this job to a separate review screen is best; less load, and we can create
something to show to the user what they did great/wrong with in the most detailed way possible.
Also leaving the in-interaction visual feedback was just more bites to the package, since we 
are mostly creating external feedback screens anyways.
