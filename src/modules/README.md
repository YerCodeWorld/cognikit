In 'assessment design', a construct is the specific knowledge, skill, or attribute an assessment 
is **intended to measure**. Unlike directly observable physical traits, these must be inferred from 
a student's responses to specific tasks.

Examples:

## **Linguistic and Literacy Constructs**

- Vocabulary knowledge: Represents the breadth and depth of an individual's **mental lexicon** 
- Grammar control: Syntactic Awareness, categorized as **procedural knowledge construct**
- Reading comprehension: Result of severl lower-level constructs (word-decoding, vocabulary)

## Economics (Economic Literacy)

- Opportunity Cost: The ability to identify the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen.
- Human Capital: Understanding how an individual's skills, knowledge, and experience are viewed as an asset for economic value.
- Scarcity and Choice: The mental framework used to understand that resources are limited and decisions must be made between competing needs.

## Spatial Intelligence

- Mental Rotation: The ability to transform and rotate mental representations of two-dimensional and three-dimensional objects.
- Spatial Visualization: The ability to mentally manipulate complex spatial information, such as imagining how a piece of paper would look if folded and cut.
- Navigation and Mapping: The mental capacity to recognize landmarks and understand the spatial relationship between different points in an environment.

And thus can be expanded with any other type of literacy be it digital, media, health, visual, cultural, and many more.

--------------------------------

An 'item type' is understood to be how a question is structured to measure cognitive demand; more broadly, it can be seen as how
a partipant interacts with information to demonstrate mental processing.

Examples:

## Match the Pairs

**Definition:** Participants select the correct relationship between two sets of information.
**Cognitive Use:** Often used to test associative memory (linking two distinct items) or semantic knowledge (e.g., matching a word to its definition).

## Fill the Blanks 

**Definition:** Participants must "construct" or generate the correct answer rather than choosing it from a list.
**Cognitive Use:** Frequently used to study the generation effect, which shows that memory is superior when a person generates information themselves.

## Unshuffle the Sentence

**Definition:** A task requiring participants to rearrange scrambled words into a coherent sentence.
**Cognitive Use:** Primarily measures executive function and working memory, as the participant must mentally hold and manipulate multiple pieces of information simultaneously.

--------------------------------

**Cognitive Operation** is understood is to be the specific mental process a learner must perform to solve a task. It describes
**how** the brain manipulates information.

# Cognitive Operations

| Operation      | Definition                                                                             |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recognition    | Identifying a correct item from a list (e.g., "Which of these is a fruit?").           |
| Discrimination | Telling the difference between two similar things.                                     |
| Classification | Grouping items into categories based on shared traits.                                 |
| Cued Recall    | Remembering information when given a hint or "cue."                                    |
| Free Recall    | Remembering information from scratch with no cues.                                     |
| Association    | Linking two related concepts (e.g., "Capital city" to "Country").                      |
| Comparison     | Identifying similarities and differences between two or more items.                    |
| Seriation      | Arranging items in a logical order (e.g., chronological or by size).                   |
| Transformation | Changing information from one form to another (e.g., a word problem into an equation). |
| Production     | Creating an original response or solution.                                             |
| Evaluation     | Making a judgment based on criteria or standards.                                      |

That above is a curated list of cognitive operations with easy-to-implement **items**.

--------------------------------

**Interaction Modality** is understood to be the physical/sensory way that the student is interacting with the item.

Examples:

- Selecting (pointing/clicking)
- Drag-and-Drop
- Typing
- Speaking
- Drawing
